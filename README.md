# Risk Board game Simulation
This program is to simulate the popular multiplayer board game called "Risk".
This project is still a work in progress. Feedback/contributions welcomed!


To begin with, I've implemented a primitive 2 player(User and Comp) version of the game.

Welcome to the RISK Battle Game!
- Initially both the armies will have the same number of territories and soldiers.
- The player gets an army; comp gets the other.
- We roll a dice and whoever gets the highest, begins the game
- On your turn, you can either attack enemy territory or defend your territory.
- The size of your contigent will be decided based on the outcome of 2 dice.
- The army with the highest outcome wins the round and the territory. 
- The winning army loses 1 soldier for every 2 enemy soldier.
- The losing side loses the contigent and the territory.
- The side which loses all its territories first or is left with less than 12 soldiers, loses the game.
